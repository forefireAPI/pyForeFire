# pyForeFire

pyForeFire is now included in the main ForeFire repository at https://github.com/forefireAPI/forefire
this repository is now  archived and discontinued


pyForeFire is a Python library for dealing with C++ library ForeFire.
It provide numerous ForeFire bindings, written with pybind11 python library.


## Building pyForeFire

### Prerequisite

- NetCDF and NetCDF-Cxx libraries (can be installed with homebrew on Mac) [`https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf`]
- ForeFire C++ library and Headers [`https://github.com/forefireAPI/firefront`]

#### Build and install wheel with Python

This will build and install pyforefire package inside current Python interpreter.

```bash
FOREFIRE_DIR=path/to/forefire NETCDF_DIR=path/to/netcdf NETCDF_CXX_DIR=path/to/netcdf_cxx pip install .
```

This will only build pyforefire wheel inside current folder.

```bash
FOREFIRE_DIR=path/to/forefire NETCDF_DIR=path/to/netcdf NETCDF_CXX_DIR=path/to/netcdf_cxx pip wheel .
```

#### Build shared library using cmake [Deprecated]

This will create pyforefire shared library inside lib folder.

```bash
cmake . -DFOREFIRE_LIB=path/to/libforefireL.dylib -DFOREFIRE_SRC_DIR=path/to/firefront/src -DNETCDF_INCLUDE_DIR=path/to/netcdf/include -DNETCDFCXX_INCLUDE_DIR=path/to/netcdf-cxx/include/

make
```

## Usage

```python
import pyforefire as forefire

ff = forefire.ForeFire()

sizeX = 300
sizeY = 200
myCmd = "FireDomain[sw=(0.,0.,0.);ne=(%f,%f,0.);t=0.]" % (sizeX, sizeY)
ff.execute(myCmd)
...
```

OR

```bash
cd test
python test.py
```

## Test pyForeFire

A test folder is included inside this repository.<br>
Each part of the code is gracefully commented, in case you want to reproduce this example.<br>
A <i>fuels.ff</i> file is also included, feel free to modify it according to your needs.
